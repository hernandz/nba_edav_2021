[["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 COVID", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 COVID 5.1.1 Approach We decided to look at average game performance based on three distinct time periods: a month of games before the bubble (10-13 games), regular season games in the bubble (8 games), and playoffs. If the playing during the COVID era changed the way the teams played, we could see change between these periods. We decided to keep the playoffs separate, because team strategies can be different and generally, the stakes are much higher. As previously explained, we focused on the Offensive/Defensive/Net ratings to evaluate the way they played. Note: not every team made it into the playoffs and are lacking that playoff data accordingly. 5.1.2 Offense Comparing the offensive performances, some teams did a lot worse in the bubble seeding games than before the break. However, just as many seemed to actually do better in the bubble. We were pretty surprised to see that, considering that it had been about 4 months of downtime. Between the seeding games and playoffs, there were also big changes in either direction. The Trailblazers totally dropped off for post-season play, while it looks like the Lakers were sandbagging in the seeding games (they ultimately won the championship). 5.1.3 Defense However, looking at the defensive performance, teams mostly did worse or about as well as they had been before the bubble. So, maybe the bubble had more of a negative effect on team defensive. The Suns and Thunder stood out with major improvement in their seeding games. Note that a lower Defensive rating means better defensive play. The X-scale has been flipped to allow for easier comparison with Offensive and Net ratings. bubble_stats_long %&gt;% filter(rating == &quot;drtg&quot;, #df_type != &quot;bubble_playoffs&quot;, ) %&gt;% mutate(ordered_teams = fct_reorder2(nameTeam, df_type == &quot;month_before&quot;, value)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = ordered_teams, x = value, color = df_type)) + geom_point() + scale_x_reverse() + scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;month_before&quot; = &quot;#00bcd4&quot;, &quot;bubble_seeding&quot; = &quot;#ff9800&quot;, &quot;bubble_playoffs&quot; = &quot;#e91e63&quot;), labels = c(&quot;Month before&quot;, &quot;Bubble seeding games&quot;, &quot;Bubble playoffs&quot;), name = &quot;Time Period&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Defensive Rating&quot;) + ylab(NULL) 5.1.4 Overall When combining the two to find the Net rating, the overall negative to neutral impact on defense is enough to swing overall performance in that direction. Overall performance for most teams looks worse or as good as before the bubble. There does not appear to be any relationship how good they were before the bubble. bubble_stats_long %&gt;% filter(rating == &quot;netrtg&quot;, # df_type != &quot;bubble_playoffs&quot;, ) %&gt;% mutate(ordered_teams = fct_reorder2(nameTeam, df_type == &quot;month_before&quot;, value, .desc = FALSE)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(y = ordered_teams, x = value, color = df_type)) + geom_point() + scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;month_before&quot; = &quot;#00bcd4&quot;, &quot;bubble_seeding&quot; = &quot;#ff9800&quot;, &quot;bubble_playoffs&quot; = &quot;#e91e63&quot;), labels = c(&quot;Month before&quot;, &quot;Bubble seeding games&quot;, &quot;Bubble playoffs&quot;), name = &quot;Time Period&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Net Rating (Offensive - Defensive)&quot;) + ylab(NULL) The negative impact on defense/net rating was interesting, but we wanted to have a control. Perhaps a similar decrease in performance could be seen at the end of a regular season. So, we made similar comparisons for the 2018-19 season. The three time periods were a month before the last 8 games, the last 8 games, and the playoffs. ## Acquiring all team PerGame general Advanced split tables for the 2018-19 season ## Acquiring all team PerGame general Advanced split tables for the 2018-19 season ## Acquiring all team PerGame general Advanced split tables for the 2018-19 season "],["section.html", "Chapter 6 ", " Chapter 6 #{r} # #starters &lt;- teams_players_stats(seasons = 2020, types = \"player\", starters_bench = list(\"Starters\")) %&gt;% # unnest(dataTable) # #top_guys_bubble &lt;- starters %&gt;% # #filter(gp &gt; 25) %&gt;% # semi_join(bubble_seeding_players, by = \"namePlayer\") %&gt;% # semi_join(covid_season_players_month_before, by = \"namePlayer\") %&gt;% # group_by(slugTeam) %&gt;% # slice_max(gp, n = 7) # #test &lt;- bubble_seeding_players %&gt;% # semi_join(covid_season_players_month_before, by = \"namePlayer\") %&gt;% # semi_join(starters, by = \"namePlayer\") # # #top_guys_bubble %&gt;% # group_by(slugTeam) %&gt;% # summarize(count = n()) # # # #d3_data &lt;- covid_season_players_month_before %&gt;% # bind_rows(bubble_seeding_players) %&gt;% # bind_rows(bubble_playoffs_players) %&gt;% # semi_join(top_guys_bubble, by = \"namePlayer\") %&gt;% # left_join(bubble_teams, by = \"slugTeam\") %&gt;% # select(name = \"namePlayer\", # team_abb = \"slugTeam\", # team_name = \"nameTeam\", # ortg, # drtg, # netrtg, # df_type # ) %&gt;% # pivot_wider(names_from = \"df_type\", values_from = c(\"ortg\", \"drtg\", \"netrtg\")) # # # #covid_season_players_month_before %&gt;% # bind_rows(bubble_seeding_players) %&gt;% # bind_rows(bubble_playoffs_players) %&gt;% # semi_join(top_guys_bubble, by = \"namePlayer\") %&gt;% # left_join(bubble_teams, by = \"slugTeam\") %&gt;% # select(name = \"namePlayer\", # team_abb = \"slugTeam\", # team_name = \"nameTeam\", # ortg, # drtg, # netrtg, # df_type # ) %&gt;% # ggplot(mapping = aes(x = drtg, y = ortg, color = df_type)) + # geom_point() + # scale_x_reverse() # # # #d3_data %&gt;% # write_csv(\"data/d3_data.csv\") # #bubble_stats_long %&gt;% # group_by(rating) %&gt;% # summarize() # # # #df &lt;- game_logs(seasons = 2019, result_types = c(\"team\")) #test &lt;- box_scores( # game_ids = 21800001, # league = \"NBA\", # box_score_types = \"Advanced\", # result_types = \"team\", # join_data = TRUE, # assign_to_environment = TRUE, # return_message = TRUE #) # ## "]]
