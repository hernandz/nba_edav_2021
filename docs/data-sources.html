<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Game statistics</h2>
<p>In the NBA, the largest source of game statistics comes from the league itself. This data is
publicly available at the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/">NBA website</a>, with some stats going back as far as 1946.
Scorekeepers are hired to watch every single game, tracking every statistic that is available to us. Many of the
statistics are raw counts of things like points, minutes played, and rebounds, while others are
calculated metrics. This does not discount the fact that the stats we see are
subject to <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-confessions-of-an-nba-scorekeeper-5345287">human error</a>,
but generally, the NBA is the best data source available for game statistics.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/abresler/nbastatR">NBAstatR</a> is a package that crawls the website to return the data directly in R. The game data is aggregated
and rolled up based on specified parameters. For example, one could request the per-game averages
of each team for the 2015 season, from March to April. The package would return a table
with a row for each team, with average statistics for allgames played in that time period. This reflects the behavior of the NBA stats
website, which does the same thing. There are 30 teams in the modern NBA, so 30 rows are always returned in requests for team statistics.
When requesting player data, the number of rows can vary because not every player plays every game and people are constantly getting added/dropped from rosters.
Generally, for the whole regular season, there are between 500-550 rows of unique player data. Less are returned for
requests of smaller windows of time, as some players may not play at all during that time.</p>
<p>Basketball stats are complicated. There are a seemingly endless amount of statistics
that are available for each player and team. For example, the “Traditional” stats reported include things
like 3 Point Field Goals Made, Free Throw Percentage, Rebounds, Assists, and Steals, among many others.
For our project, we were most interested understanding <em>general</em> team/player performance, which can be
difficult to discern from all of those statistics. So, we focused on the
Offensive, Defensive, and Net ratings. The Offensive rating can be understood as
the amount of points produced on offense when the player was on the court, while Defensive rating can be understood as
the amount of points allowed on defense when the player was on the court. The way these are
calculated are somewhat <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ratings.html">complicated</a>,
but are a good way to understand general performance. Team versions of these ratings are calculated
based on the underlying player statistics.</p>
<div id="covid-cases" class="section level3" number="2.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> COVID cases</h3>
<p>A single table was scraped from a <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/nba/nba-coronavirus-covid-list/">basketball magazine’s website</a>
(SLAM) to get a list of players that were confirmed to have COVID, and when it was reported by the magazine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="player-positions-and-injuries" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Player positions and injuries</h2>
<p>We also needed other data that went beyond game statistics: player position data and injury data.
The NBA also makes this data somewhat available on its website, does not aggregate and release it
as conveniently. Player position data is limited only to forward, guard, and center,
while most think of the game as played in 5 positions - point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center.
Injury data available on the website is only for current injuries, and is not historical.</p>
<p>////EXPAND VVV
We turned to <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ratings.html">Basketball Reference</a> for more complete player profiles. T
his data is collected by a parent organization that manages
several sports databases. The core of its historical data <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/sources.html">comes from</a>
Sean Lahman, a researcher/journalist famous for compiling open source sports data and encyclopedias.</p>
<p>Injury data was scraped from <a href="http://www.prosportstransactions.com/">Pro Sports Transactions</a>, which compiles data that is released by the NBA.</p>
</div>
<div id="issues" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Issues</h2>
<p>When we compare a “month” of game data for each team, each team may not have played
the same amount of games due to scheduling. The sample for each average can be
slightly unequal by +/- a game played from team to team. The solution to this would be to obtain averages based
on the number of games played before a certain date, but the API lacks this slicing capability.
It might be possible pull the box scores of every single game, count out and filter based on date, and then create the averages manually,
but this approach would be a significant amount of work for perhaps a small change in results. As previously stated,
we are looking for differences in general performance.</p>
